Geomundo is a batch manipulation program for satellite images for use in the remote sensing of conservation targets. Gemundo uses Large Sacale Mean Shift (LSMS) segmentation and functions without the use of training data. Geomundo has the capability to add/remove, manipulate, create and concatonate image bands as well as create mosaics for images in your input folder. Geomundo has the capability to apply different parameters to identical images in an input folder or simply apply the same parameters to non similar images in the input folder.
